# cnn_eis_model

There are two models

1. The large model with mobilnet convolutional layer

2. A simple test with a loss=NaN. For this, a .pickle file needs to be generated, with the image.ipynb file this is done.

Also, there are two .csv with the results, one was done with 64x64 giving an accuracy of 37%, the other was done with 128x128 images and increase a little bit the accuracy (42%).
